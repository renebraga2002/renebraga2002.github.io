            <p>I already have a portfolio page, you can check that out in the nav bar. So instead I think I'll just make this assignment a webpage that just shares a few things I find cool ^^</p>

            <h2>1. My Dog Oliver</h2>
            <img src="olly.jpg" width="40%" alt="pictureOfOliver">
            
            <p>This is my dog Oliver he's an Aussie and sometimes we call him just Olly. He's such a polite cutie patootie and I love him so much but he's also really shy and he makes me think a lot of Luigi.</p>
            
            
            <h2>2. <a href="https://youtu.be/-wX-284cZGg?si=VV6UKq7-B99kMOao" target="_blank">This Video</a> I Really Like</h2>
            <img src="miku.jpg" width="60%" alt="pictureOfMiku">
            
            <p>This video of this dog is so silly and it uses this Hatsune Miku song "Popipo" it's one of my favorite Vocaloid songs (it's quite the earworm).</p>
            
            <h2>3. Annalynn (Video Game)</h2>
            <img src="anna.jpg" width="60%" alt="pictureOfAnnalynn">
            
            <p>This is <i>Annalynn</i> it's a video game my friend made (my name is even in the special thanks!) and it's really fun it's like an arcade platformer that reminds me a lot of things like Pac-Man and Mappy it's only $5 you should check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1508460/Annalynn/" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
